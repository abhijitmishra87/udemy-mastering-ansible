# udemy-mastering-ansible

my configs for the www.udemy.com mastering-ansible course,
including fixed/enhanced vagrant setup and the working files
as things progress.

note: the Vagrantfile assumes the hostmanager plugin is installed via:

'''
vagrant install plugin hostnmanager
'''


If you run docker, you'll want to change all references here to 'eth1' to be 'eth0'...
